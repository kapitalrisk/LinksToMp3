### YT2MP3 ###

This project aim to retrieve Youtube videos and convert it to audio file.
A lot of libraries doing this exact action already exists.
The goal of this crappy implentation is rather not to re-invent the wheel but just an excuse to better experiment with .NET 4.5+ Tasks.
It already uses a open source library (YoutubeExtractor - https://github.com/flagbug/YoutubeExtractor) and I am planning on using another well knowned one (that I cannot find for whatever reason) for playlist handle.

	- EVOLUTION or EVOL : places where better practices could be found to improve code overall performance / reliability
	- FIXME : Parts of code needed to be updated for a complete comfy runtime experience (like logs...)
