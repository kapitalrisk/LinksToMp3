### TODO ###

Solution :
	- Find a good .NET gitignore

Tests :
	- FileManager open / read / directory filenames
	- config with dummy / null / etc

FileManager :
	- parse links file with csv ?

Tools :
	- rawContent to IEnumerable<string> for csv links

Main :
	- Define core execution logic :
		- Interactive? 1-1-1 (1 vid info => download => convert)? Ite (all vidInfo => all ...)?
		- See "FIXME Logs" for fluent execution logic
		- Implement logs for better full version debuging
	- Config :
		- Add possibility to only download / only convert / create a file containg parsable list of already process videos stuff like that

Processing Task :
	- define better implentation : list of actions, list of tasks with each continues?
	- does 'scenarios' are a thing in Tasks like 'full handle of link' end to end so we make a task.continue.continue...
	- Need main beforehand

EVOLUTIONS :
	- Define a yt2mp3 exception type
	- Add more formats capacities (audio in particular)
	- Playlist handling
